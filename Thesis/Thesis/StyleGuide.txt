Tentative Style Guide

* Most, though not necessarily all, classes, methods, properties, etc. should be documented with xml.

* If there is time, add #if DEBUG conditional compiling tests to each method so that when running in debug mode, the inputs and outputs for each method are validated.

* Don't sort the data inside methods if avoidable. The user of the method should provide sorted data, and it should be labeled as such in the parameter list.

* Likewise, if there is time, consider moving RNG specification out of lower-level methods/objects and have it pass through parameters, so high-level code overtly specifies the RNG for lower level code.
  This allows greater clarity and flexibility in the use of different generator instances in each thread, etc. which are seeded by the base instance.
