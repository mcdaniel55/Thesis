Tentative Style Guide

* Most, though not necessarily all, classes, methods, properties, etc. should be documented with xml.

* If there is time, add #if DEBUG conditional compiling tests to each method so that when running in debug mode, the inputs and outputs for each method are validated.

* Don't sort the data inside methods if avoidable. The user of the method should provide sorted data, and it should be labeled as such in the parameter list.
